Neural Scene Flow Prior (NSFP) and Fast Neural Scene Flow (FNSF) have shown remarkable adaptability in the context of large out-of-distribution autonomous driving. Despite their success, the underlying reasons for their astonishing generalization capabilities remain unclear. Our research addresses this gap by examining the generalization capabilities of NSFP through the lens of uniform stability, revealing that its performance is inversely proportional to the number of input point clouds. This finding sheds light on NSFPâ€™s effectiveness in handling large-scale point cloud scene flow estimation tasks. Motivated by such theoretical insights, we further explore the improvement of scene flow estimation by leveraging historical point clouds across multiple frames, which inherently increases the number of point clouds. Consequently, we propose a simple and effective method for multi-frame point cloud scene flow estimation, along with a theoretical evaluation of its generalization abilities. Our analysis confirms that the proposed method maintains a limited generalization error, suggesting that adding multiple frames to the scene flow optimization process does not detract from its generalizability. Extensive experimental results on large-scale autonomous driving Waymo Open and Argoverse lidar datasets demonstrate that the proposed method achieves state-of-the-art performance.

### Prerequisites
This code is based on PyTorch implementation, and tested on PyTorch=1.13.0, Python=3.10.8 with CUDA 11.6 or PyTorch=1.12.0, Python=3.9.15 with CUDA 11.6. 
But it should work fine with a higher version of PyTorch.

A simple installation is ```bash ./install.sh```. For a detailed installation guide, please refer to [FastNSF](https://github.com/Lilac-Lee/FastNSF).
